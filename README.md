# ToDo App - MERN Stack

## Description

To build a MERN stack app, practicing the express routing, nodejs middleware, and core React concepts.

Creating a MERN app requires both frontend and backend knowledge, and how the code interacts between them to build efficient and smooth apps.
In the process of creating this app, it requires me to not only think of just one aspect(front or back), but how to organize forms, data and structure to achieve
a seamless application between the client and server.

A Todo app is a simple concept, but it requires the entire CRUD operations which allows me to practice interacting with MongoDB(via Mongoose) and manipulating the data.

## Installation

No prior environment setup is required, as the app is hosted on servers(separate for backend and frontend code). Just vist my webpage [here](https://todoapp-ff3f1.web.app/).

## Usage

You may add new notes via the form right after the navigation bar.

Notes appear and refresh thereafter on the list before. There are individual buttons for editing(patch) and deleting the individual notes.
 
## Code Features
To summarize coding concepts that I have learnt and practice in this app:

React(Frontend)
- using basic hooks like useState, useReducer
- creating a custom hook, i.e. useForm for both creating a new note and editing an existing note
- design quick components using react-bootstrap and also using vanilla bootstrap classes
- prop-drilling and lifting state via functions

NodeJs & MongoDB(Backend)
- express routing
- middleware concept (for CORS handling)
- organizing code using MVC concept
- mongoose models and schemas, and manipulating data using querires
